### Data Science and Business Analytics Program Portfolio

This repo consists of projects procurred during my [post graduate certification](https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/candace-bunkley) from February 2022 through September 2022. Each project allowed me to learn more of the fundamentals of data science and business analytics using Python.

At the top of each project, you will see the total points I was given for the project, as well as the business case provided. The dataset for each project was provided in .csv format and I used Jupyter notebook or google colab for all projects.
